# simple-api
This is a project created by following the tutorial from web dev simplified.
You will learn how to write codes without writing too many callbacks, and you will see many async and await in the code.

## Prerequisites
1. Having MongoDB in your devices, you may also use your MongoDB Atlas account. But it would be more recommended to use your local database.
2. having REST Client VS Code extension or any other tools you think have the similar purpose, as this project does not have any front end in it.

## How to use it
1. clone the repo
2. type `npm i` in your terminal, when the current working directory is under where you store this.
3. make a .env file and add DATABASE_URL=<connection string of your mongodb>
4. just type `npm run start` to run it, or `npm run devStart` for demo while modified it.
